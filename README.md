# test-repo
Second test. Restarting repo. 

## Advice!
Always pull before you push. 

    $ git pull origin master

You must add changed files to the commit before you can commit
 
    $ git add FILENAME.ext 
    $ git add . 

Always include a message in your commit command line -- NEVER use text editor in git bash

    $ git commit -m "Message goes here"

Finally, push push push!

    $ git push origin master
